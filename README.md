# visAPPprot - An Analysis and Visualization System for Omics

visAPPprot provides alternative visualizations for common omics (e.g., RNAseq; Genomic or Proteomic Microarrays) outputs.

visAPPprot includes the familiar omics visualizations: Volcano Plot, Pathway Map, Heatmap. Clustering to analyze subsets of the input dataset is also available.

visAPPprot allows creation of the the Context Map visualization, which introduces top-level biological context to narrative visualization. Context maps are generated in a semi-automated manner by inferring relations between biological entities from the input dataset while allowing user modifications and additions to the context map output. In addition to the arrows, icons, and text annotations that are common to biology diagrams, important contextual information is provided in the form of biological categories in a legend and location of entities in a human diagram. This form of context is maintained across all context maps, regardless of the dataset. The context map can be viewed as a static image, or within an interactive interface.
